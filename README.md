# MetaCall Hacktoberfest 2022
Repository for the Hacktoberfest 2022 submissions. This year we are participating in Hacktoberfest with **[Aviyel](https://aviyel.com/projects/106/metacall)**. There will be rewards depending on your contributions to MetaCall Organization.

You can participate by creating some of the following ideas or implementing something new. If you want to participate, please create a pull request in this repository first, in order to evaluate the idea or submission. You have the following ideas as starter but we are open to accept new ones. Contributions to existing repositories are also accepted. Please check the ones pinned in the MetaCall Organization or ask to us through our community chats.

 1) Write a Telegram Bot to be deployed into [MetaCall FaaS](https://dashboard.metacall.io) (possibly with [MetaCall Deploy CLI](https://github.com/metacall/deploy)).
 2) Making a Rust example with interop with Python or NodeJS showing some functionality (i.e Actix or similar mixed with NodeJS or Python, or using a Rust crate from Python or NodeJS).
 3) Complete tutorial about using [MetaCall Deploy CLI](https://github.com/metacall/deploy)and deploying functions, services and/or static files into [MetaCall FaaS](https://dashboard.metacall.io).
